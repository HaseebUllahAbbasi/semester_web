/** Bubbling and capturing
 * 
 * When an event happens on an element,
 * it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

/**

 * stop the browserâ€™s default behavior when performing an action
 *

 * event.stopImmediatePropagation()
 * This method is used to prevent the propagation of an event as defined in the capturing/bubbling phase of the flow of an event in the browser.
